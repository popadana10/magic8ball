# Magic 8-Ball Fortune Teller

This project is a Magic 8-Ball program that emulates the classic fortune-telling toy. Users input a yes-or-no question, and the program provides a random response from the Magic 8-Ball.

## How It Works

- Users input a yes-or-no question into the program.
- The program utilizes conditional statements to select and display one of several predefined responses from the Magic 8-Ball.
- Responses are randomly chosen, giving each question a sense of unpredictability and mystique.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive interface for asking questions.
- Randomized responses for a fun and engaging user experience.
- Implements conditional statements to determine the response based on the user's question.
